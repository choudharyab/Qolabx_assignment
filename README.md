Why i use nodejs in this project?

         I used nodejs in this project because it is asynchronous JavaScript where one task do not have to wait for other task to be completed.
It is single threaded. The response time of nodejs is faster than other programming languages. Suppose in php when we are uploading the photo we have to wait for some time because it blocks other threads whereas nodejs does not block.
We can easily resolve and reject unwanted response in the nodejs. The main advantage of nodejs are as follows:

•	Node.js is fast: Node.js uses JavaScript in the backend, and that’s enough to understand how fast the codes execute. Moreover, it runs on the Google’s V8 engine, which compiles the JavaScript directly into machine code making it faster than most.

•	The ever-growing NPM: Being an open-source technology, node.js has a shared repository of good-to-go tools and modules. The number of modules in the Node   Package Manager (NPM) has increased at a considerable pace, just on the verge of overtaking the RoR (Ruby on Rails) gems.

•	Real-time web apps: The event-driven architecture of node.js is appropriate for real-time applications, especially chat applications and games. As both the client-side and the server-side are written in JavaScript, the synchronization process is better and quicker. Web socket protocol comes into picture here.

•	Productivity: The productivity of a web app increases several folds with node.js because a lot of time is saved in between the lines. Merging the front-end and back-end into a single entity makes it efficient. That also implies a lesser number of employees and more profit on your side. PayPal reported 2 times increase in developer productivity after using node.js.
